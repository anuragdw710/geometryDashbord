# Graph Drawing App

- **Purpose**: A React-based application to input graph data, validate it, and visualize the graph interactively.
- **Input Format**: Users provide the number of nodes, edges, and edge connections in a simple text format.
- **Validation**: The app checks for valid input data, ensuring the nodes and edges are correctly defined.
- **Graph Visualization**: Nodes are movable, and edges are stretchable for easy manipulation and exploration.
- **Technology Stack**: Built with React and `vis-network` for dynamic graph rendering.
- **Responsive UI**: Includes styled buttons and footer, with smooth transitions and hover effects.
